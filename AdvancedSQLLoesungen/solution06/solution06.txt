Aufgabe 01

SELECT legs, species, height
FROM (
    (select *
     from Dinosaurs AS d
     WHERE  d.legs = 2
     ORDER BY d.height DESC
     LIMIT 3)
    union
    (select *
     from Dinosaurs AS d
     WHERE  d.legs = 4
     ORDER BY d.height DESC
     LIMIT 3)
     )d
order by legs,d.height DESC;


Aufgabe 02

(a)

select dataset,
avg(x)::result as x_mean,
avg(y)::result as y_mean,
stddev(x)::result as x_stddev,
stddev(y)::result as y_stddev, 
corr(Y, X)::result as correlation
from Analysis
group by dataset
order by dataset;


Compare these statistical measures, we can see that every value of them are the same.

(b)

a:dinosaur, b:bone, c:pentagram, d:Oval, e:double Oval.
