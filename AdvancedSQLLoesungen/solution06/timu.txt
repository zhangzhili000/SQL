1. 
SELECT locomotion .legs , tallest . species , tallest . height
FROM ( VALUES (2) , (4)) AS locomotion ( legs ),
LATERAL ( SELECT d.*
FROM Dinosaurs AS d
WHERE d. legs = locomotion . legs
ORDER BY d. height DESC
LIMIT 3) AS tallest ;
Rewrite the SQL query without the use of LATERAL.

2.
-- Define result as type alias for NUMERIC (3 ,1).
CREATE DOMAIN result AS NUMERIC (3 ,1);
CREATE TABLE Analysis (
dataset CHAR (1) ,
x NUMERIC ,
y NUMERIC
);
\ copy Analysis FROM '/ ABSOLUTE / path /to/ data .csv ' WITH ( FORMAT csv , HEADER TRUE );
(a) Write an SQL query which calculates the mean of x as well as y, the standard deviation of x as well as y and the correlation coefficient of columns x and y1. Each of the results has to be of type result,as previously defined. 

3.

CREATE TABLE Lists (
id INTEGER NOT NULL ,
pos INTEGER NOT NULL ,
slice TEXT [] NOT NULL ,
CONSTRAINT list_id_range CHECK (id
>= 1 AND id <= 3) ,
PRIMARY KEY (id , pos )
);

Write an SQL query which returns a table that holds one column for each of the three lists. Additionally,add a column i to represent each index of each element in the nal list. In each list, concatenate the slices in ascending pos order.
