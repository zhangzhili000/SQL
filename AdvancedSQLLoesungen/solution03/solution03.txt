with CTE as
(
SELECT P.val
FROM P
WHERE P.val > 5
)
SELECT T.x AS t_x
FROM T
WHERE T.x IN (select * from CTE);

2)
with c as
(
SELECT P.val
FROM P,T
WHERE P.val > T.y and T.x = P.val 
)

SELECT T.x AS t_x
FROM T
WHERE T.x IN
( SELECT * from c);

yes,if there are many subqueries to deal with ,using CTE can be more starightforward. Using CTE just like getting a temporary table ,  we can directly query in the temporaty table , and it can be many times used. It¡¯s easier to use a Table name instead of the whole subquery expression.
