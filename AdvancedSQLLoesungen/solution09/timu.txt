1. 
Write an SQL query which calculates each value of the Fibonacci sequence1 up to any value i starting with 1. 

2. 

CREATE TABLE Trees ( tree int PRIMARY KEY ,
parents int [],
labels text []);

Adapt the following query such that multiple nodes of the same tree may carry the same label (e.g., label f may occur more than once). 

3. Travel by Car
your car only holds up to 100 units of fuel and each unit lets you travel a single distance unit. Therefore, if the fuel runs out in the middle of the road, your travels come to an abrupt end. Luckily, some cities allow for refueling.
write an SQL query, which lists every city you are able to reach with your car.
