Leider nicht ganz korrekt. -2p

Folgende Lösung wäre möglich:

-- C: conductivity (speed  of the  simulation \in (0,1))
\set C 0.1
-- N: # of  iteration  steps
\set N 100

WITH  RECURSIVE
flow(t,x,y,z) AS (
SELECT 0 AS t, h.x, h.y, h.z
FROM    Heat AS h
UNION  ALL
SELECT f.t + 1 AS t,
       f.x, f.y,f.z + :C * (
         SUM(f.z) OVER (PARTITION  BY f.y ORDER BY f.x ROWS  BETWEEN 1
               PRECEDING  AND 1 FOLLOWING) - 3 * f.z
       + SUM(f.z) OVER (PARTITION  BY f.x ORDER BY f.y ROWS  BETWEEN 1
               PRECEDING  AND 1 FOLLOWING) - 3 * f.z
       ) AS z
FROM    flow AS f
WHERE   f.t < :N
)
-- Resulting  heat  map (aggregated  only to  render a 2D representation)
SELECT f.y, array_agg(f.z ORDER  BY f.x) AS z
FROM    flow AS f
WHERE   f.t = :N
GROUP BY f.y;
