2. [5 Points] 
Create an instance of the table R with schema R(a INTEGER, b INTEGER), where the two different queries Q1 and Q2 compute differing results.
-- Q1
SELECT R.a, COUNT (*) AS c
FROM R
WHERE R.b <> 3
GROUP BY R.a;
-- Q2
SELECT R.a, COUNT (*) AS c
FROM R
GROUP BY R.a
HAVING EVERY (R.b <> 3);

3. [10 Points] 
We define the table as follows.

CREATE TABLE ProductionCycles (
product_name CHAR (20) NOT NULL ,
step INTEGER NOT NULL ,
completion_date DATE , -- NULL means incomplete
PRIMARY KEY ( product_name , step )
);

Write an SQL query which lists all product_names of completed production cycles once. A production cycle is complete, when every completion_date of a cycle is not NULL.

4. [15 Points] Matrix Multiplication

CREATE TABLE A (
row INTEGER ,
col INTEGER ,
val INTEGER ,
PRIMARY KEY (row , col )
);

CREATE TABLE B (
row INTEGER ,
col INTEGER ,
val INTEGER ,
PRIMARY KEY (row , col )
);

(a) Write an SQL query, which performs a matrix multiplication A * B.

(b) Is it possible to apply the SQL query from (a) to the following matrices in which some entries are missing? Explain.
