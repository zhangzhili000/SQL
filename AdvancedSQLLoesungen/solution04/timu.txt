1. 
FROM ( VALUES (1, '2':: MONEY ,4) ,(2,'$5 .72 ' ,1.32) ,(3,'$2 ':: MONEY ,5.77) )
Extract the FROM-clause of this query into a permanent table P 

2. 
Write an SQL query which uses geometric objects and operations to estimate the value of pi using the "Monte Carlo method":

1) Place a circle c with radius r = 1/2 at point m = ( 1/2 ; 1/2 ). The area of c is pir^2 = pi/4.

2) Generate random points p in unit square (0;0) - (1;1). The area of the square is 1.

3.
(a) 
temporary table JSON_data
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE JSON_data (
data JSON
);
COPY JSON_data FROM E'/ ABSOLUTE / path /to/ AllCards . json / here ';
a permanent table MTJ with a suitable PRIMARY KEY
CREATE TABLE MTJ (
name TEXT PRIMARY KEY ,
manaCost TEXT ,
cmc NUMERIC ,
type TEXT ,
text TEXT ,
power TEXT ,
toughness TEXT
);
write an SQL query which accesses the JSON attributes from table JSON_data and populates
table MTJ with their values.
(b) List the cards with maximum and minimum cmc value. Disregard cards with a cmc value of 0 or less.
(c) List all cards of type Enchantment but exclude cards of type Enchantment-Aura.
(d) List the first five cards with the highest cmc. The listed cards should satisfy the following predicates:
Power or toughness are greater than 14 or power is less than toughness. Ignore cards with power or toughness containing the character *.
(e) List all cards with names in ascending order. The manaCost has to contain at least one and at most three U.
